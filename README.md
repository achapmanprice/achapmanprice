Historian of Christianity
* Theology and Society
* Medieval Women's Religious Literature
* Mysticism in the Christian Tradition

I am interested in the intersections of race, sex and gender with medieval Christianity, the theology of medieval women's religious texts, and the development of Christian mysticism throughout the tradition. My work explores the marginalized theologies of medieval women as well as the ways in which medieval history is relevant to discourses today on race, sex, gender, power, and religion.
