                           <p>The folium appears free of damage from rodents, insects, and fire, but
                              some small staining can be seen, particularly in the bottom margin.
                              The parchment shows variation in color throughout, including the
                              stains, but a clearly rectangular segment in the lower right of the
                              verso (covering about 4/5 of the text) is lighter in color than the
                              surrounding parchment. This suggests either that this rectangular
                              segment received a different amount of exposure to light than the rest
                              of the parchment over a sustained period of time or that binding glue
                              was applied to the parchment surrounding the rectangle. The parchment
                              appears likely to have been trimmed from its original size, since the
                              top and outer margins are smaller than might be expected. Fold lines
                              are not apparent. A pin-prick sized hole is on the outer margin of the
                              second line from the top.<lb/></p>

                        <p>Written in <term>Carolingian miniscule</term> with ovoid and compressed
                           characteristics of <term>Protogothic</term> or

                        <p>Scripts of various size are used to distinguish between various parts of
                           the breviary. For example, passages for readings are larger than the
                           instructions for chant (as in the shift from larger to smaller script
                           between virtutum and si in r. line 4) and titles of antiphons or
                           versicles may be smaller than liturgical directions (as in the shift from
                           smaller to larger script between vobis and excepta in r. line 10).
                           Headings are in red (Processi et Martiniani Capitulum, r. line 24).
                           Notation for the hours of the office are inconsistently rubricated;
                           rubricated examples include ad primum and ad tertiam (r. line 22),
                           whereas ad uesperos et matutinum (r. line 12) is written in the brown ink
                           of the text.</p>
                        <p>The aspect of the script is vertical, with straight upright strokes and
                           round bows; n, m, and u similarly have vertical minims and rounded
                           connections. Ascenders and descenders do not extend far beyond the
                           text-line, resulting in a neat and nearly square line of text with a
                           small ratio between the minims and the ascenders. Ascenders, such as for
                           l and d exhibit spatulate and forked tops. Initial I may rest on the text
                           line, as in Iterum (v. line 18) with a tall ascender; alternatively,
                           initial I may curve below the text line as in Ille (r. line 1; v. line
                           16), particularly in order to distinguish between I and the double
                           ll.</p>
                        <p>Morphology of note includes the following: vertical Uncial a has a round
                           bow with only a slight hook curving above; d is seen in both vertical and
                           uncial varieties (even within the same word, as in dedi in r. line 18); f
                           typically rests on the line; g is drawn with a relatively vertical
                           descender that rounds gracefully with an open bow below the text line;
                           round r, capital r, and r with hooked shoulder are used; round and long s
                           are both used, with round s typically reserved for initials,
                           abbreviations, and the end of words; x looks like a tiny j conjoined with
                           c; y sports a decorative dot between its arms.</p>
                        <p>Orthography: This manuscript displays a consistent habit of using e in
                           place of ae in many words. For example, eternarum for aeternarum (r. line
                           4) and cetere for ceterae (r. line 8). This orthographic habit seems to
                           be at work in the hymn title Oliv[a]e bin[a]e (r. line 11). Also, the use
                           of c in place of t is remarkable, as in tercium (r. line 7), Exspectacio
                           (r. line 25), and preciosis (v. line 25). However, the reader will remark
                           agnitionem (r. line 14). Contempnere with a p (v. line 20) is of
                           note.</p>
                        <p>Abbreviations include the following: nomina sacra (for example, Christo
                           r. line 2); common abbreviations for pro, prae, and post; interesting
                           "cross bar" abbreviation for per, which does not truly cross the
                           descender but rather consists of a rightward stroke from the descender; a
                           superscript bar for final m or n (or for en in the case of tamen in r.
                           line 1); superscript “oc” a or "open a" as in aliquando (r. line 2) and
                           Priusquam (r. line 17); backward c or curved 9-shape for final us, as in
                           ambobus (r. line 6); superscript elaborate 2-shape for ur as in nocturnos
                           (r. line 4) and canatur (r. line 7); round r with a crossed tail
                           following o for -orum as in membrorum (r. line 3). An abbreviation for
                           lectione(m) is formed by an l with upward-reaching, diagonal branches on
                           each side. This is used both alone (r. line 11) and in combination with
                           other letters, as in dilectione (r. line 10). Psalmos (r. line 9) is
                           abbreviated with a capital P with superscript sos, and feriales
                           immediately after abbreviates the final es with a curved stroke extending
                           from the l. Nostris (r. line 24) boasts an interesting morphology:
                           abbreviating the internal ostr of the word is an r whose minim descends
                           below the text line and sprouts a horizontal seat with two chair legs.
                           <lb/>Single initials are used to abbreviate words that would have been
                           easily intuited by the users of this breviary (usually, the second or
                           third word in the title of an antiphon or hymn). In these cases, such as
                           with terram (r. line 8), iugum (r. line 9), and mundi (r. line 10), the
                           single-letter initial is both preceded and followed by a punctus.
                           Ligatures include the following: ct ligature as in octavo (r. line 19);
                           st ligature as in tribuisti (r. line 15); IN ligature (r. line 19).</p>
                        <p>Punctuation: The manuscript uses punctus, punctus elevatus, and punctus
                           interrogativus. Punctus are used to mark off numbers in roman numerals
                           and one-initial abbreviations for words. Three small clusters of neumes
                           grace lines 17, 18, and 22 of the recto. </p>
                        <p>Decoration: Initial letters are decorated with red and black penwork. Red
                           shading fills the internal spaces of the black initials, such as the
                           bottom and top bows of capital B (Beati, r. line 5), the space above and
                           below the bar on H (Hoc, r. line 7), and the space under the top stroke
                           of T (Tollite, r. line 9). Initial letters also display decorative serifs
                           on each stroke (except for capital O and for capital G, whose bar is a
                           continued curve from the body). Often, the curved or straight serifs end
                           in a tight roll or dot. Capital E (as in Expectacio, r. line 25) and
                           Uncial E (as in Eodem, v. line 6) are both used. In a few places (as
                           within the concave spaces of the curved S in Si, r. line 4, and of the C
                           in Cotidie, r. line 9), smaller capitals penned in the normal brown ink
                           of the text also receive rubricated decoration. </p>

                     <handNote xml:id="Marginalia" scope="minor">
                        <p>Marginalia: Five faded additional lines of marginalia on the bottom of
                           the verso (v. lines 30-34) includes three prayers. The script is
                           different from that of the breviary’s text. Noticeably, g as in
                           suffragantibus (v. line 32) has a flat top with a descender extending
                           from the left of the top stroke and curving down, then right, and back
                           around, similar to an Arabic numeral 5. Also, a has a smaller, more
                           thorn-like bow with a longer, more curved arch above; the final descender
                           of m curves below the letter in some places (as in martini); some letters
                           appear more square as in the boxy “round s” and square p, whereas the
                           shaft of t is more curved; r has a more open aspect, appearing similar to
                           a modern v, and lacking the characteristic sharp hook of the breviary’s
                           script. The superscript bar in the marginalia is curved on both sides,
                           creating an elongated sideways s shape, whereas the superscript bar in
                           the breviary’s text is flat with an upward stroke on the right.
                           Abbreviations in the marginalia include nomina sacra; common
                           abbreviations for per, pro, and prae; 9-shape for -us; superscript
                           abbreviations for -er (s-shape) and -ur (infinity shape); and qs with
                           superscript bar for quaesumus. The final Per [Dominum...] punctuates the
                           prayers with an enlarged abbreviation evocative of a cross.</p>

                        the scribe's intention seems to have been the use of "a" as an ending for

               additional lines of marginalia on the bottom of the verso, comprising three prayers,
               are written in a different hand. The script is different from that of the breviary’s
               text. Noticeably, g as in suffragantibus (v. line 32) has a flat top with a descender
               extending from the left of the top stroke and curving down, then right, and back
               around, similar to an Arabic numeral 5. Also, a has a smaller, more thorn-like bow
               with a longer, more curved arch above; the final descender of m curves below the
               letter in some places (as in martini); some letters appear more square as in the boxy
               “round s” and square p, whereas the shaft of t is more curved; r has a more open
               aspect, appearing similar to a modern v, and lacking the characteristic sharp hook of
               the breviary’s script. The superscript bar in the marginalia is curved on both sides,
               creating an elongated sideways s shape, whereas the superscript bar in the breviary’s
               text is flat with an upward stroke on the right. Abbreviations in the marginalia
               include nomina sacra; common abbreviations for per, pro, and prae; 9-shape for -us;
               superscript abbreviations for -er (s-shape) and -ur (infinity shape); and qs with
               superscript bar for quaesumus. The final Per [Dominum...] punctuates the prayers with
               an enlarged abbreviation evocative of a cross.</note> Please see the <ref n="website"
